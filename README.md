<p>This project aims to develop an AI model capable of predicting and assisting in disaster management using satellite imagery and sensor data. The model will focus on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and earthquakes and aid in evacuation planning, supply distribution, and damage assessment. 
By analyzing real-time data, the AI will provide actionable insights, helping authorities mitigate damage, reduce casualties, and improve disaster recovery efforts.</p>
